            	<p>The Mission of the Club of Budapest is to be a catalyst for the transformation to a sustainable world through</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Promoting the emergence of planetary consciousness</li>
						<li>Interconnecting generations and cultures</li>
						<li>Integrating spirituality, science, and the arts</li>
						<li>Fostering learning communities worldwide</li>
					</ul>
				<p>The philosophy of the Club of Budapest is based on the realization that the enormous challenges that humanity is currently facing can only be overcome through the development of a global cultural consciousness. The view of the Club of Budapest is focused on a cultural consciousness with a global perspective. Like Greenpeace fights for ecological issues, UNICEF for children, and Amnesty International for human rights, the Club of Budapest stands for global consciousness. Its mission is to be a catalyst for the transformation to a sustainable world. The Club perceives itself as a builder of bridges between science and art, ethics and economy, between cognition and realization, between old and young, as well as between the different cultures of the world. One of the prime objectives of the work of the club is the initiative "You Can Change the World".</p>
